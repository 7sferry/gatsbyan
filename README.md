## Step to Install:
- run 'npm install'

- execute 'npm run develop' on cli
- your site would be run on http://localhost:8000

## Step to get SpaceId and Token:
- after login and open the homepage content, click burger menu on the top left

- go to media tab and publish all draft images (by default heroImage is required and you can't build your site with
  unpublished images)

- open setting tab and choose 'API keys'. Click 'Add api key' on the top right. Copy space ID and token to your '.env'
  file you created before

- execute 'npm run develop' on cli
- now you should be able to access your content at http://localhost:8000


You can deploy your site to any static site hosting like netlify, vercel, or anywhere. There is webhook on netlify
and you can set this up later to your site hosting for content update everytime you publish your content.
